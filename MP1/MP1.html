                    <p><strong>Overview and Usage</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                    It can be difficult to stay focused while getting work done, especially since entertainment is at a click of a button.
                    This is why I decided to make a browser extension that creatively blocks the site I tend to get distracted on, Netflix.
                    With this extension, while it is active, you will not be able to see any Netflix preview pictures, and to be able to see what
                    movies and shows there are, you must individually hover over every single show and movie. This becomes tedious over time, and allows
                    the user to think twice about wasting their time. To add on, every preview photo on Netflix will be replaced by a gif of the meme "Just Do It!", 
                    in hopes of motivating the user to "just do it" and to stop getting distracted (as the genre titles say).

                    Since my browser extension is not hosted online, in order to run the code you must download the files via GitHub and
                    follow instruction in developer mode on Google Chrome to load an unpacked extension from your files. From there you can bookmark
                    the extension and pull up Netflix, and the extension should be good to go.

                    <p><strong>Development Process</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Before beginning this assignment, I watched and followed a long on a Youtube video
                            about changing images on a screen into a different image (link provided in kudo section
                            below). After learning the steps in the video and understanding the reasoning behind each
                            step, I started working on the manifest.json file first. In that file, I named my browser extension,
                            gave it a description, set icons for the extension, and assigned a popup.html to it. Most importantly,
                            in the content script, I put down Netflix's website for the matches so that my browser extension 
                            only applies to Netflix websites. I struggled a lot with this step because the tutorial said to use anyurl
                            within the quotes, but I didn't want my extension to apply to all URLs. 
                            <br><img class="pic" src="tutorial.png" style="width:500px"> </img>
                        </li>
                        <li>Next I moved on to the content.js file. This file inlcudes a method that includes justDoIt that lets
                            it equal the gif I wanted on Netflix's website.
                            <br><img class="pic" src="matches.png" style="width:500px"> </img>
                            By using the method, Element.getElementsByTagName("image"), I was able 
                            to parse through every image on the loaded screen, and set the image to equal the new justDoIt object. I first used a for loop to go through images on the screen and randomly select a gif that I wanted to use. But I realized I just want one gif, so I don’t need to use a randomized function. 
                            <br><img class="pic" src="random.png" style="width:500px"> </img>
                            I took the randomized function away to see if it works, and it did. But I still wasn’t sure if a for loop was necessary.
                            <br><img class="pic" src="content.png" style="width:500px"> </img>
                        </li>
                        <li>The rest of the steps are included setting up a popup.html for the popup and styling it using a css file. The bulk of the 
                            project falls in manifest.json and content.js because that's where I had the most difficulty with.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Issue Deep-Dive</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As previously mentioned, an issue I ran into was making the browser extension Netflix specific. I began writing the code for the 
                            extension first using the anyurl code, and later tried different ways of making it just Netflix website specific. In order to resolve it, it
                            actually ended up being a lot simpler than I thought. At the end of the url I had to put an apostraphe and a backslash.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
           
                
                    <p><strong>Ideas and Future</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the future, I would like to add an off switch in the pop-up that comes up on Chrome. With this,
                            the user can have the option to stop the Netflix pictures from being blocked without actually deleting the extension.
                            Something else I would like to add would be to completely take off any descriptions that already exist on Netflix,
                            and not just the headlines.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
