            <p> <strong>I'm a fourth year Human Centered Design and Engineering (HCDE) 
                student at the University of Washington (UW) with a strong background
                in the medical field.</strong></p>
            <p> In 2018, I attended UW's Math Academy where I became acquainted with HCDE with 
                the help of Dr. Sheldon Levias. I was fascinated by the field
                of HCDE and its focus on the human experience, which had always been my focus
                while volunteering and shadowing in healthcare. One project that my team worked on during
                our months at Math Academy was designing an app to help students' mental and emotional health.
                We spent time researching, prototyping, and interviewing UW students on their thoughts about the app.</p>
            <p>This project sparked a big interest in me, the cross between research, design, and communication
                was one that I enjoyed. As I participated in HCDE projects during Math Academy, links quickly formed between
            shortcomings I had witnessed in healthcare and what HCDE had to offer in solutions. </p>
            <p>A little more about me, I enjoy activities that allow me to utilize my creativity, design, or artistic skills.</p>
            <p><strong>When I'm not in class or working on homework, you can find me...</strong></p>
