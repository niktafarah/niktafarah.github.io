                    <p><strong>Overview and Usage</strong></p>
                    <ol>The core functionality of this project is to use p5.js to create static and dynamic sketches.

                    <p><strong>Development Process</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Before beginning this assignment, I first followed along with a few static and dynamic
                            example sketch tutorials on Coding Train to gather a basic understanding of the foundations
                            of p5.js.  
                            
                        </li>
                        <li>After understanding the basic functionality in p5.js, I followed a tutorial for making my first static sketch.
                            After following the tutorial, I thought about what I wanted to do for my unique sketch. I decided to keep the theme of all 
                            of my sketches to be a flower. <br>
                            <br><img id="sketch" src="../438/1sketch.png" alt="Static sketch" onclick="location.href='../MP2/1sketch.html';" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="cursor: pointer;"> </img><br>
                            <br>After that, my next step was to create the same static sketch, except make it refresh to a slightly
                            different sketch everytime the refresh button is pressed. I did so by utilizing the refresh button.
                            The third sketch was also very similar in that regard, except instead of a random() function, I created a for loop
                            and made the value of the petal width increase every time it went through the loop.
                        </li>
                        <li>Lastly, for sketches 5 and 6, they were very similar since they both used audio to work. Sketch 6 was particularly difficult
                            for me, especially since my computer was being very laggy and sometimes my own microphone wouldn't work so it was difficult to know
                            when my code wasn't working.
                        </li>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
    
                    <br>
                
                    <p><strong>Issue Deep-Dive</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An issue I spent the longest amount of time on was sketch 4, and this was due to the fact that 
                            I had trouble figuring out where to place my petalSize variable. The variable was to add value after every iteration.
                            This was more of a logic error than a syntax error. I fixed this problem by taking a step back and explaining the reason
                            for each variable and function and also running it in Codepen. These methods combined allowed me to find my solution.

                    </ul>
           
                
                    <p><strong>Ideas and Future</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the future I would like to make the grass more dimension, perhaps by adding texture, movement, and shadows. 
                            Also, for sketch 6 it would be helpful to have a button that would start and stop recording audio for visual output. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
