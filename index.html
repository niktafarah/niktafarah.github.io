          <p> <strong>I am a UX Designer and researcher with diverse skills ranging from physical product design 
            and front-end web developement. Based in Seattle, Washington, I graduated with a degree in Human Centered Design
          and Engineering from the University of Washington, where I immersed myself in the world of UX Design and Research.</strong></p>
      
          <p>As an Iranian immigrant, I deeply value and understand <strong>the significance of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion both within a workplace
            and within the design process.</strong> I strongly believe that diverse perspectives and experiences enrich the design solution we create
            and enable us to build inclusive products that cater to a wide range of users.
          </p>
          <p>My journey into the field of User Experience began in the medical field. Witnessing the struggles faced by immigrant
            communities in understanding their healthcare  providers when translators were unavailable, I was motivated to seek answers to the question:
            <strong>"How can the hospital system, medical applications, or hospital devices be redesigned to benefit everyone, regardless of what language they
            speak?"</strong>. This experience ignited my passion for UX and set the foundation for my design philosophy.
          </p>
          
          <p>Throughout my diverse professional experience in UX, I've emphasized the importance of inclusive design as a guiding principle
            in all my projects. I strive to create designs that meet the needs of diverse users, ensuring accessibility and benefits for everyone,
            regardless of their background. With a deep understanding of UX design principles, attention to detail, and a passion for meaningful user-experience,
            I'm dedicated to crafting innovative solutions that <strong>become the liason for the gap between technology and people.</strong> Through collaboration
            with multidisciplinary teams and user-centered research methods, my goal is to deliver intuitive and impactful designs that positively 
            transform users' lives. <strong>Let's work together to create user-centric and inclusive experiences that leave a lasting impact.</strong>
