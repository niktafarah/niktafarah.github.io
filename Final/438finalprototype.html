                    <h2>Final Project Prototype</h2>
                    <p><strong>Overview and Usage</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                    In my game, I replicated a two dimensional basketball game which awards the user points at 10 point increments, and once the user
                    reaches 40 points the player wins and can choose to play again. 
                    To play the game, you can click on the screen, and the ball will follow the mouse. In order to get points, you must aim the ball into the hoop
                    or bounce off the wall. 

                    <br>

                    </ol>
              
                    <p><strong>Development Process</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I first changed the basketball to look like a mouse and changed the background and floor to be pink.
                            <!-- <br><img class="pic" src="in.png" style="width:500px"> </img> -->
                        </li>
                        <li>Next I followed the Firebase tutorial from class to set up a basic firebase.js.
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>For my next step I altered the function sendMessage in my firebase.js to output a score equivalent to the finalScore when the timer hits zero in my index.js.
                        </li>
                            
                        <li>Next I had to change my index.js so that it included a start up screen and a closing screen. On top of this I added a timer that would
                            only begin when the player clicked.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
    
                    <br>
                
                    <p><strong>Issue Deep-Dive</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I ran into many issues for this final prototype, the first of which were making the timer. I fixed this issue by assigning a variable 
                            screen to have the value of 0, and depending on whether the player had clicked or not, that number would go up and signify a new page (with an if statement).

                            My next, biggest, issue was that the score that would show up when the game ended was linked to my index.js therefore it wouldn't 
                            go to Firebase. To fix this, I used the function sendMessage(score) in firebase.js to send a score rather than message to firebase.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
           
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Ideas and Future</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the future, I might change the game rules and change the timer to be more than 10 seconds long. I am also ideating for something in the game
                            that might cause penalty for the user, but I have not thought about it yet. If I don't do that, then it is likely that I will link a randomized function to the 
                            net to make it change location. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Kudos</strong></p>
                    <p>Kudos to Annie for helping me link my score to Firebase!</p>

                    <p><strong>Project scope</strong></p>
                    <p>Now that I have completed my prototype, I want to make a leadership board across all users (not user specific).
                    I have added a timer to my final project which wasn't originally inn the project, and I believe this will 
                    make the game more fun.</p>
                    <br>

                    <p><strong>Time management</strong></p>
                    <p>I anticipated Firebase taking a long time to learn, but I still didn't anticipate how 
                        long it would take for me to learn it. Also, I had problems deploy my website, and even now 
                        at the time of submission, my website is not showing up and I will have to get help in class tomorrow.
                        </p>                   
                        <br>

                    <p><strong>Implementation plan</strong></p>
                    <p>How has your implementation plan for your final version changed now that
                         you have completed your prototype? Why has it changed?

                         As explained earlier, I will be creating a user-wide leadership board. I have decided to change this because
                         it will be a greater challenge than just storing the scores in Firebase, and this will be a way to practice retrieving data from Firebase.
